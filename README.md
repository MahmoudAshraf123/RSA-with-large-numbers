# -RSA-

##### implementation of RSA Public-Key Cryptosystem for very large numbers.

##### large numbers that connot be stored in int or any datatype, so we store the number as string and make operations on it to encrypt or decrypt:
##### 1- sum
##### 2-devide-
##### 3-Efficient Multiplication. Implement the efficient integer multiplication (less than N2) using the Karatsuba algorithm
##### 4-Division
## Objective:
##### the main objective is to encrypt or decrypt the input at a specific time with minimum complexity.
##### read input from SampleRSA.txt file and write output to SampleOutPut.txt file.
